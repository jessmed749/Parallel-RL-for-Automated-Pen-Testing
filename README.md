# ECE379K---Automated-Pen-Testing
We will build a hybrid CPU-GPU reinforcement learning simulation environment that trains AI agents to act as attackers in a network. Multiple CPU threads will simulate attack attempts across different network states in parallel, while a GPU-accelerated policy network learns from those attempts and updates the agentsâ€™ strategies.
